# User Guide

GoodMatch (GM) is a **desktop app for managing applicants and job listings, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, GM can get your applicant and job listing management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps

# Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `goodmatch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases). //change the link for this
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your GoodMatch.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar goodmatch.jar` command to run the application.


A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.

<aside>
ℹ️ ************************Notes about the command format:************************

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.e.g. in `add t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Chicken Rice Uncle`.
- Items in square brackets are optional.e.g `t/TITLE [a/APPLICANT]...` can be used as `t/Chicken Rice Uncle a/John Tan` or as `t/Chicken Rice Uncle`.
- Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.e.g. `[a/APPLICANT]…` can be used as  `` (i.e. 0 times), `a/applicant1`, `a/applicant2 a/application3` etc.
- Parameters can be in any order.e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.e.g. if you specify `t/Chicken Rice Uncle t/Chicken Rice Auntie`, only `t/Chicken Rice Uncle` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
