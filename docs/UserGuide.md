# User Guide

GoodMatch (GM) is a  **desktop app for managing applicants and job listings, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, GM can get your applicant and job listing management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps

# Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java  `11`  or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest  `goodmatch.jar`  from  [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases). //change the link for this
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the  *home folder*  for your GoodMatch.
4. Open a command terminal,  `cd`  into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the  `java -jar goodmatch.jar`  command to run the application.

A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.

# Features

ðŸ’¡ **Notes about the command format:**

* Words in  `UPPER_CASE`  are the parameters to be supplied by the user.e.g. in  `add n/NAME`,  `NAME`  is a parameter which can be used as  `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.e.g  `n/NAME [t/TAG]`  can be used as  `n/John Doe t/friend`  or as  `n/John Doe`.
* Items with  `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.e.g.  `[t/TAG]â€¦`  can be used as    ``  (i.e. 0 times),  `t/friend`,  `t/friend t/family`  etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.e.g. if the command specifies  `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,  `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`  is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.e.g. if you specify  `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only  `p/56785678`  will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as  `help`,  `list`,  `exit`  and  `clear`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specifies  `help 123`, it will be interpreted as  `help`.
