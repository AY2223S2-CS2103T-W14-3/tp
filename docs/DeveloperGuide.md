# Setting up, getting started

## Setting up the project on your computer

<aside>
❗ Caution: Follow the steps in the following guide precisely. Things will not work out if you deviate in some steps.

</aside>

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use IntelliJ IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html)* to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)* to import the project into IDEA. 

<aside>
💡 Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.

</aside>

1. **Verify the setup**:
    1. Run the `seedu.address.Main` and try a few commands.
    2. [Run the tests](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/Testing.html) to ensure they all pass.

## Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style** 

    If using IDEA, follow the guide *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)* to set up IDEA’s coding style to match ours.


<aside>
💡 Tip: Optionally, you can follow the guide *[[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html)* to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems *as* you write code.

</aside>

1. **Set up CI**

    This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up is required.

2. **Learn the design**

    When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get a sense of the overall design by reading about [AddressBook’s architecture](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#architecture).

3. **Do the tutorials** These tutorials will help you get acquainted with the codebase.
    - [Tracing code](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/tutorials/TracingCode.html)
    - [Adding a new command](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/tutorials/AddRemark.html)
    - [Removing fields](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/tutorials/RemovingFields.html)
