## **Overview**

GoodMatch (GM) is a **desktop app for managing applicants and job listings, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), specifically catering to HR managers in charge of tracking job listings across many platforms. If you can type fast, GM can get your applicant and job listing management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps

### Architecture

<p>
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" />
  <em>Architecture Diagram for GoodMatch</em>
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p>
  <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Architecture Sequence Diagram for GoodMatch</em>
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p>
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" />
  <em>Sequence Diagram for the Managers in GoodMatch</em>
</p>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<p>
  <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Structure of the UI Component</em>
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Listing` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component
**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p>
  <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Structure of the UI Component</em>
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ListingBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a Listing).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<p>
  <img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p>
  <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" />
  <em>Class diagram for the Parser classes</em>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ListingBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ListingBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<p>
  <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Class diagram for the Model Component</em>
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Listing` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueListingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Listing` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Listing>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user‚Äôs preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ListingBook`, which `Listing` references. This allows `ListingBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Listing` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<p>
  <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>A better Class diagram for the Model Component</em>
</p>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<p>
  <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Class diagram for the Storage Component</em>
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both listing book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ListingBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo feature

#### Overview

The undo mechanism utilises the `prevListingBookStates` field in `ModelManager`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#undo()`‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâRestores the previous listing book state from its history.
* `Model#hasPreviousState()`‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâChecks if there are available listing book states in the history to undo into.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `prevListingBookStates` will be initialized with an empty `ArrayList`.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th listing in the listing book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitListingBook()`, causing the modified state of the listing book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `prevListingBookStates`.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add t/Coder d/code‚Äã` to add a new listing. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitListingBook()`, causing another modified listing book state to be saved into the `prevListingBookStates`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitListingBook()`, so the listing book state will not be saved into the `prevListingBookStates`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the listing was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which restores the previous listing book state by setting as the `listingBook` and deleting it from `prevListingBookStates`.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `prevListingBookStates` is empty, then there are no previous ListingBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasPreviousState()` to check if undo is possible. If not, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the listing book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitListingBook()` or `Model#undo()`. Thus, the `prevListingBookStates` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
